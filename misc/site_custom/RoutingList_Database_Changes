In order to support Pinset Masons custom Routing Slips
with the copyright and vacation features
the following database changes are required

Add the rlcopyright table
add the copyright field to subscription

Add the vacation_flag field to borrowers and deleted borrowers

The original scripts to do this have been moved from atomicupdates to here as changes to the installer
have robbed atomicupdates of their atomicity

NB when upgrading ensure that the Result classes for these tables are regenerated as otherwise
the vaction_flag  cannot be updated!!!
